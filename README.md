# nosql-challenge

Contributor: Alex Calametti 

Overview
For this module challenge Mongo DB was utilized to evaluate different ratings of establishments across the United Kingdom for editors of a food magazine. This project consisted of three parts: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up, Updating the Database, and Exploratory Analysis. In order to complete this project Mongo DB and pandas must be installed along with Python programs. The establishments.json and the NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb and NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb jupyter notebooks in the resources folders were also used. 

Parts 1 & 2: Database Setup and Updating
To setup the database an instance of MongoClient must be created. Then, the addition of the database was checked and the collection was saved as a variable. To update the database, dictionary information for a new restuarant was added, restaurants in Dover were removed as they were not an area of interest, and the value types of different cetegories in the dictionary were changed. 

Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
For the final part of this project, queries were created to find data fitting differing criteria. A pipline was also created to find data pertaining to one of the criteria requested. All of the findings were saved as Pandas DataFrames. 

Big thanks to my tutor Geronimo Perez for helping me get started and learning assistant Peter for helping me troubleshooting the pipeline in Part 3.
